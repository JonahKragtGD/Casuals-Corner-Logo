                <h2>Design Summary</h2>
                <p>The Casuals Corner was a project I have only recently started. I wanted to find a way to create a series and identity within my YouTube page to help spark some creativity and get that YouTube train rolling again. The main idea of the page is to talk about the games I like to play in a very lighthearted casual sense in the same way you talk about games with your friends. Casuals Corner stems from the idea that a lot of gamers want to push “casuals” into their own corner, dismissing opinions they would consider “casual”. It’s something I’ve touched upon in my Jonah Kragt YouTube page, the idea that people are ashamed of being casual. Yet that’s exactly the vibe I want to put out. I play games with friends on the regular, sure we like to compete and get into it, but at the end of day it’s about blowing off steam after work, or smashing a few beers while playing halo.</p>

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>For the design I wanted to reflect this. I started by sketching block letters and a simple three line corner for simplicity and identity. I played around with a C in C, and perspective concept as well, but once that went to digital it did not look the way I liked. Something I went with very early was the idea of RGB color identity that I was able to explore once I brought the sketches onto the computer.</p>

                <h2>New Logo</h2>
                <p>To explain the RGB color identity from above I wanted this to align with the Jonah Kragt YouTube Logo design of few opposing colors to represent the different aspects of casual gaming. Which are: Red - Intensity (the aforementioned smashing beers with my buddies while playing Halo). Green - Represents the healthy nature of playing games casually and using it as a way to grow and maintain friendships. Blue - Emphasizes the slow calm casual nature at which most people play games. Think something like Minecraft, the Sims, or most mobile games. As for the typeface GoodTimesRG-Regular, you may have recognized this from my logo I did for the band Spectrum. I love this typeface as a display signature. It is retro futuristic, sleek, and fits the idea I am going for when it comes to Casuals Corner. We live in a digital age, and with the RGB color format of the logo I wanted a typeface that would connect that theme.</p>
